# Design Project 2

Design Project 2 is meant to mimic the format of the capstone project. In project 1, you tackled a real world issue. In project 2, you will produce an experimental work designed to further develop your concept development and production skills. In this project, you will develop a project concept, methodology, documentation of your process, and a presentation of the outcomes. Your work will then be collectively displayed in a class-wide exposition of your work on a Penn State only website.

Please have a look at the list of digital design project categories. These categories are

## Deliverables

1. Project pitch
2. Production Reports
3. Project Image \(Image should represent project\)
4. Project files for class exhibition of work  
   1. Images, video, PDF Document, executable file download, Zip archive of files, URL of live hosted website \(not a link to a service such as InvisionApp\), production blog URL.

5. Define a project proposal \(3 weeks\)  
   1. Outcomes  
   2. Context and impact  
   3. Themes  
   4. Scope: What can you do in 6 weeks?  
   5. Identify a production process and timeline

6. Identify faculty or industry mentor

   * If a group project, it roles and workload must be defined.

7. Check-ins with mentor
   1. Notes or takeaways from meeting with mentor
   2. Student facilitates meeting by being prepared to show progress and have questions for mentor.
8. Project deliverables
   1. Project should either be based on a clearly defined career intention or a well defined concept and theme. Expressive art projects must be well articulated in the project statement.
   2. 500 Word Minimum Statement
   3. Fully functional digital artifacts
   4. PDF Documentation complies with presentation guidelines
9. Deliver a final presentation and contribution for student exposition of work.
10. Mimic's capstone project requirements
11. Presentation quality
12. Emphasis on presence of design language

## Peer reviews

**Inductive process:** Describe, analyze, interpret, informed comment \(judgement\).

1. **Describe:** What do you see?
2. **Analyze:** What do you know about it. What is happening or not happening.
3. **Interpret:** What could be happening or shouldn't happen?
4. **Informed comment:** Use design language to comment on the work.

## Project template

1. Read project brief
2. Choose Design Area of Focus
   1. This should include digital media or digital tools
3. Develop a project plan
   1. The plan must include a short description
   2. 
4. Develop a software pipeline
5. Develop a pitch presentation and PDF export
6. Evaluate pitch feedback
7. Re-work project pitch documents based on feedback
