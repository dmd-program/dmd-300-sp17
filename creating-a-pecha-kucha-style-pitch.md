# Creating a pecha-kucha presentation

To get a quick overview and an example of this style of presentation, see this Youtube video produced in 2007 by Dan Pink for Wired Magazine: [Pecha Kucha: Get to the PowerPoint in 20 Slides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NZOt6BkhUg)


**The rules for this format of presentation are simple:**

1. Create only 20 slides
2. Slides automatically advance every 20 seconds
