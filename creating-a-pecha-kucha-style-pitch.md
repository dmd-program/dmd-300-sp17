# Creating a pecha-kucha presentation

See this background and a pecha-kucha presentation example: [Pecha Kucha: Get to the PowerPoint in 20 Slides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NZOt6BkhUg) produced in 2007 by Dan Pink for Wired Magazine.


**The rules for this format of presentation are simple:**

1. Create only 20 slides
2. Slides automatically advance every 20 seconds
