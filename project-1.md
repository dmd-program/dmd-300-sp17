# Project 1 : Co-design challenge

In this project, you will work in small team to design a product, service, or social design intervention. Your team will build your own project sprint structure by selecting sprint elements and setting them to a timeline. After the design sprint period is over, you will evaluate how it went.

## Overview:

### Week 1: Team meet and greet

1. Agenda items for the meeting
  - Introductions
  - Decide on team collaboration tools. A more comprehensive list is located on the [collaboration tools page](/collaboration-tools.md).
  - Identify meeting times
  - Discuss types of digital media that are of interest to the group
2. Identify design challenges or topics. It may be beneficial to bring some ideas to the initial meeting, or to convene a second meeting later.

### Week 2: Seek inspiration

### Week 3: Develop a design sprint

1. **Create a sprint timeline.** Choose design and research methods and put them to a timeline. Describe what occurs in each session. For instance, if using DesignKit or Google Venture methods, name the method explicitly:
   - Research
   - Ideation or concept development
   - Production or iteration
   - Analysis and feedback
2. **Set roles and responsibilities.** Members may have multiple roles. See [team roles](/team-roles.md) page for a list of roles.

### Week 4-6: Implement your design sprint

### Week 6: Project document

1. **Project Document**.  
   - Requirements
     1. Cover/title page: 
       - project title
       - date
       - team members
       - course name 
       - instructor(s)
     2. Project summary
       - Topic or challenge
       - Describe why the topic is interesting, important, or novel. Does it reimagine, reframe, refactor, re-contextualize, or otherwise perform remix or invention?
     3. Design challenge
       - Analyze and deconstruct the issue using [form and context analysis](https://www.core77.com/posts/69273/Book-Review-Notes-on-the-Synthesis-of-Form).
       - [Identify forces that impact form](https://vimeo.com/10875362)
       - Include figures and diagrams of these relationships
       - Describe media used for digital production. For example, print, web, info-graphics, game/interactive, animation, video/film, audio/sound, physical installation, etc.
     4. Team
       - Member names and bios that include relevant interests, skills, and capabilities.
     6. Design process overview
       - Timeline of events
       - List methods used with brief descriptions
       - Anticipated outcomes of each step
     7. Outcomes documentation
       - Include images, diagrams, figures, drawings, links to videos and websites, etc.
     8. Lessons learned
       - Assess how well the design process worked. What might be done to improve upon it?
     9. Bibliography
   - **Formatting:** PDF document in US Letter size.
     - Proofread and spellcheck.

### Week 7: Design sprint assessment

Please fill out the design sprint assessment. You will be assessed on your ability to analyze benefits and issues inherent in your process, and your ability to imagine ways of correcting.
Issues could include availability of team members, feeling of meaningful contribution, equal footing, roles assignment, was the brief you defined in the etc.
