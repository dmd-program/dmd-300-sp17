# Project 1

## Description

In this project, you will work in small team to produce a design process, digital media, and documentation. Your team will build it's own project by setting meeting agendas, creating a concept pitch, develop and use a design process/sprint structure, track and document progress using a project blog, and produce project documentation. The project outcomes can take the form of any combination of digital media formats including 2D, 3D, video and motion design, interactive and web, UX/UI app design, and product design. The projects could emphasize a wide range of approaches including tool building, product or service, marketing or awareness campaigns, calls to action, open-source tools, traditional or experimental digital story telling, speculative design, wayfinding, identity systems, toolkits, educational materials, etc.

**The project's concept focus word:** "Nudge"

The word "nudge" in the design sense refers to small adjustments or changes that can have a large impact to behavior or positive outcomes. Your team is encouraged to steer this project in a direction based on your interests.

## Project overview

### Phase 1: Gather and organize

Meet with your team and begin to establish meeting times and meeting agendas.

#### Agenda items for design meetings

The following are some recommended items to consider for meeting agendas. Ultimately, you are responsible for crafting meeting agendas:

1. Introductions or icebreaker
2. Read through the project document, look at provided resources, and discuss any questions about the project that the team may have \(Please send questions to your instructor if you are still unclear after this discussion\).
3. Decide on team collaboration tools. A more comprehensive list is located on the [collaboration tools page](/collaboration-tools.md).
4. Identify meeting times.
5. Discuss types of digital media workflows, tools, and formats that are of interest to the group.
6. Identify design challenges or topics. It may be beneficial to bring some ideas to the initial meeting, or to convene a second meeting later to spend more time discussing. The project's focus word is meant to give you a starting point, and guide any design thinking activities, similar to the ones used in the Double Diamond process in DMD100. You can [refer back to DMD100](https://dmd-program.gitbooks.io/dmd-100-sp19/content/) at any time if you do not recall the activities that were used. 
7. Decide whether to assign team member roles. If roles are desired, what are they and who are they assigned to?
8. Determine clear project outcomes and goals.

### Phase 2: Develop a design sprint

You will develop a preliminary design sprint schedule document and [project blog](http://sites.psu.edu).

The document should include:

1. **Cover/title page** 
   * **Title:** Design Sprint Schedule
   * Date
   * Team member names
   * Course name
   * Instructor\(s\)
2. **Schedule:** Consult the [design process and methods page](/design-process-and-methods.md) to choose design and research methods that fit your team's needs and interests. Place the chosen methods onto a schedule. Name the method and describe what occurs in each session with the anticipated outcomes.
   * **Session:** Day, time, duration of session
   * **Method name:** Include one or more methods for each category in the following list. You may repeat categories and methods as often as needed, and they do not all need to be collaborative or group based:
     * Research, discovery
     * Ideation, concept development
     * Production, testing, iteration
     * Analysis, feedback
   * **Description:** Briefly describe how the method works and the anticipated outcomes from using the method. 

The project blog should be hosted using [Sites and Penn State](http://sites.psu.edu). Your team should use this blog to track the progress of the project and to show interesting project outcomes.

* If any project team members are concerned about privacy, project members may use a pseudonym \(pen name\) and in addition, the blog is able to be password protected to Penn State WebAccess users. Please contact your instructor if this is a concern and need help with blog configuration.

#### Submission details:

1. Publish a link to the project blog, even if currently blank, on the related Canvas discussion.
2. Upload a .zip file to the canvas assignment that includes:
   * Link to the blog in the assignment submission
   * Design Sprint Schedule document in PDF format.

### Phase 3: Pitch

Produce a short [pecha-kucha](/creating-a-pecha-kucha-style-pitch.md) style presentation that explains the project concept. Use presentation software to design the presentation. Please include:

1. **Video:** Clearly legible text or voice narration
   * If doing voice narration, you can choose one team member to narrative, or have different members contribute narration of different slides.
2. **PDF export** of slides used for the pecha-kucha video.

#### Submission details:

1. Post the pitch to the project blog.
2. Upload a .zip file to the canvas assignment that includes:
   * Pitch video \(Please export/compress this video. It should be less the 500MB in filesize\)
   * PDF export of the slides

### Phase 4: Design sprint

![sprint timeline graphic](/assets/timeline@2x.png)

1. **Rule number one in art and design - if it's not documented, it never happened.** Please keep detailed and dated notes, photos, screenshots, video recordings, and other forms of documentation of team meetings, brainstorm sessions, concept research, design sprints or working session outcomes, etc. This will help your team immensely when crafting the project document, and will mostly likely be referred back to quite often. Consider keeping these materials in a shared team folder. See [collaboration tools](/collaboration-tools.md) for information on available resources.
2. **Consider setting roles and responsibilities.** Members may have multiple roles. See [team roles](/team-roles.md) page for a list of roles.
3. If your team feels that the design process isn't working as intended, feel free to change up the design of the sprint. However, don't give up too early, sometimes you have to trust the process to give it a chance to work.

#### Submission details:

1. Publish 4 or more detailed posts to the [http://sites.psu.edu](http://sites.psu.edu) blog that you created to track your project's progress from the design sprint. Upload media and write descriptions and other relevant information.
2. The end results of the design process are included in what gets published on this blog, they do not need to be uploaded to canvas other than what is included in the project document PDF.

### Phase 5: Project document

#### Requirements

1. **Cover/title page:** 
   * Project title
   * Date

## Team conflict

Though working on a design team as part of a class project can not fully mimic real-world project teams you will encounter or already have encountered, it should suffice for helping you understand the general concepts and ideas. Finding a team that meshes immediately and is good at resolving internal conflict makes for a very productive and gratifying project experience. Unfortunately, when this doesn't happen, team dynamics can be counterproductive. If you run into any issues with your team members that cannot be resolved, please communicate with them with your instructor so they may step in and help mediate the situation.
