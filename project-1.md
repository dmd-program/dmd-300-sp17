# Project 1 : Design for Intervention


In this project, you will work in small team to design a product, service, or social design intervention. Your team will build your own project sprint structure by selecting sprint elements and setting them to a timeline. After the design sprint period is over, you will evaluate how it went.

## Project overview:

### Week 1: Team meet and greet

1. Agenda items for the meeting
  - Introductions
  - Decide on team collaboration tools. A more comprehensive list is located on the [collaboration tools page](/collaboration-tools.md).
  - Identify meeting times
  - Discuss types of digital media that are of interest to the group
2. Identify design challenges or topics. It may be beneficial to bring some ideas to the initial meeting, or to convene a second meeting later.

### Week 3: Develop a design sprint

1. **Create a sprint timeline.** Choose design and research methods and put them to a timeline. Describe what occurs in each session. For instance, if using DesignKit or Google Venture methods, name the method explicitly:
   - Research
   - Ideation or concept development
   - Production or iteration
   - Analysis and feedback
2. **Set roles and responsibilities.** Members may have multiple roles. See team roles page for a list of roles.

### Week 3: Develop a design sprint

1. **Project Document**.  
   - Requirements
     1. Cover/title page: 
       - project title
       - date
       - team members
       - course name 
       - instructor(s)
     2. Project summary
       - Topic or challenge
       - Describe why the topic is interesting, important, or novel. Does it reimagine, reframe, refactor, re-contextualize, or otherwise perform remix or invention?
     3. Design challenge
       - Analyze and deconstruct the issue using [form and context analysis](https://www.core77.com/posts/69273/Book-Review-Notes-on-the-Synthesis-of-Form).
       - [Identify forces that impact form](https://vimeo.com/10875362)
       - Include figures and diagrams of these relationships
       - Describe media used for digital production. For example, print, web, info-graphics, game/interactive, animation, video/film, audio/sound, physical installation, etc.
     4. Team
       - Member names and bios that include relevant interests and skills
     6. Design process overview
       - Timeline of events
       - List methods used with brief descriptions
       - Anticipated outcomes of each step
     7. Outcomes documentation
       - Include images, links to videos, diagrams, figures, drawings, etc.
     8. Bibliography
   - **Formatting:** PDF document in US Letter size.
     - Your instructor will review and provide feedback if necessary.

### Week 4-6: Implement your design sprint

### Week 7: Design sprint assessment

Please fill out the design sprint assessment. You will be assessed on your ability to analyze benefits and issues inherent in your process, and your ability to imagine ways of correcting.
Issues could include availability of team members, feeling of meaningful contribution, equal footing, roles assignment, was the brief you defined in the etc. 










## Project Brief

In this project, you will work in small team to design an awareness campaign for an important issue. 

## Project process

1. Form a team
  - 3 team members
2. Choose an important issue that has little awareness.
   - The issue be general enough that many people are affected, but specific enough that you can find credible information about it. 
   - Look at well known issues, and highlight lesser known, yet crucial aspects of those issues.
3. Research the issue using design research methods and credible sources
   - You are encouraged to reach out to experts in the field.
4. Analyze and deconstruct the issue
   - Form and Context analysis
   - "Bound the form"
   - Identify forces that impact form
   - Diagram these relationships
5. Identify awareness opportunities
6. Choose primary media for digital production
   - Print, web, info-graphics, game/interactive, animation, video/film, audio/sound, etc.
7. Create a document and pech-kucha "style" pitch deck that highlights:
   - The issue and the people affected
   - The audience for the awareness campaign
   - The types of media that will be produced. 
   - Doc Reqs:
      - Project Timeline
      - Development process steps
      - Tools, assets, methodologies, and outcomes 
      - Personnel responsibilities
8. Create Project Blog/website
9. Members choose roles and develop contract agreement
10. Begin production. Post updates to a public blog or equivalent.
11. Instructor check-in
12. Final work presentation uploaded online


## Schedule

1. Read project brief
2. Make group preferences \(Otherwise groups will be assigned by instructor\)
3. Meet with your group members
4. Confirm member roles
5. Evaluate feedback
6. Rework project pitch documents 

## Deliverables

1. Pitch Proposal
   - Defined team roles and responsibilities
   - Topic or Issue
   - Design process: Identify Research and Design Thinking Methods 
2. Project Explainer Presentation 
   - **Content Sections**
     1. Overview
     2. Design Principles
     3. Outcomes
     4. Insights/Take-aways
   - **Formats**
     1. Video/Screencast of the presentation being narrated with voice or text.
     2. Export Powerpoint or Google Slides as a **PDF**. Upload only the PDF.
3. Project Documentation
   - PDF
