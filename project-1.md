# Project 1 

## Description

In this project, you will work in small team to produce a project that. Your team will build it's own project sprint structure by selecting design process elements and setting them to a timeline. Your teem will set meeting agendas, create a concept pitch, develop and use a custom design sprint structure, track and document a process using a project blog, and produce project documentation. The project outcomes can take the form of any combination of digital media formats including 2D, 3D, video and motion design, interactive and web, UX/UI app design, and product design. The projects could emphasize a wide range of approaches including tool building, product or service, marketing or awareness campaigns, calls to action, open-source tools, traditional or experimental digital story telling, wayfinding, identity systems, toolkits, educational materials, etc.

**The project's concept focus word:** Nudge

**Research starting points:**

- [NPR TED Radio Hour](https://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/483080945/nudge)
- [Freakonomics Podcast: Big Returns From Small Thinking](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/big-returns-thinking-small/)
- [PSU Library resources](https://psu.summon.serialssolutions.com/search?s.fvf=SourceType%2CLibrary+Catalog%2Cf&s.q=nudge+unit&s.l=en#!/search?ho=t&fvf=SourceType,Library%20Catalog,f&l=en&q=design%20nudge)

## Objectives

**The purpose of this project is to help you: **

- Gain experience working in a design team
- Practice developing a design process
- Practice evaluating and reflecting on the effectiveness of a design process
- Select and test design methods, techniques, and tools to produce digitally designed, critically engaged, and systemically considered creative explorations and outcomes 
- Produce a detailed project documentation
- Practice publishing skills by keeping a [team project blog](http://sites.psu.edu/)

## Project overview

### Phase 1: Gather and organize

Meet with your team and begin to establish meeting times and meeting agendas.

#### Agenda items for design meetings

The following are some recommended items to consider for meeting agendas. Ultimately, you are responsible for crafting meeting agendas:

1. Introductions or icebreaker
2. Read through the project document, look at provided resources, and discuss any questions about the project that the team may have (Please send questions to your instructor if you are still unclear after this discussion).
3. Decide on team collaboration tools. A more comprehensive list is located on the [collaboration tools page](/collaboration-tools.md).
3. Identify meeting times.
4. Discuss types of digital media workflows, tools, and formats that are of interest to the group.
5. Identify design challenges or topics. It may be beneficial to bring some ideas to the initial meeting, or to convene a second meeting later to spend more time discussing.
6. Decide whether to assign team member roles. If roles are desired, what are they and who are they assigned to?
7. Determine clear project outcomes and goals.


### Phase 2: Develop a design sprint

1. **Create a sprint timeline.** Choose design and research methods and put them to a timeline. Describe what occurs in each session. For instance, if using DesignKit or Google Venture methods, name the method explicitly:
   - Research
   - Ideation or concept development
   - Production or iteration
   - Analysis and feedback
2. **Set roles and responsibilities.** Members may have multiple roles. See [team roles](/team-roles.md) page for a list of roles.
3. Create a project blog using [Sites and Penn State](http://sites.psu.edu) to track your team's progress.
4. Publish a link to the project blog on the related Canvas discussion.

### Phase 2: Pitch

Produce a short [pecha-kucha](/creating-a-pecha-kucha-style-pitch.md) style presentation that explains the project concept. Please inlcude:

1. **Video:** Clearly legible text or voice narration
  - If doing voice narration, you can choose one team member to narrative, or have different members contribute narration of different slides.
2. **PDF export** of slides used for the pecha-kucha video.
3. Post the pitch to the project blog.

### Phase 4: Sprint!

![sprint timeline graphic](/assets/timeline@2x.png)

1. **Rule number one in art and design - if it's not documented, it never happened.** Please keep detailed and dated notes, photos, screenshots, video recordings, and other forms of documentation of team meetings, brainstorm sessions, concept research, design sprints or working session outcomes, etc. This will help your team immensely when crafting the project document, and will mostly likely be referred back to quite often. Consider keeping these materials in a shared team folder. See [collaboration tools](/collaboration-tools.md) for information on available resources.
2. If your team feels that the design process isn't working as intended, feel free to change up the design of the sprint.

#### Submission details:

1. Publish 4 or more detailed posts to the http://sites.psu.edu blog that you created in Phase 3 to track your project's progress. Upload media and write descriptions and other relevant information.

### Phase 5: Project document
 
#### Requirements

 1. **Cover/title page:** 
   - project title
   - date
   - team members
   - course name 
   - instructor(s)
 2. **Team**
   - Member names and bios that include relevant interests, skills, and capabilities.
 3. **Summary**
   - Concept statement: Brief description of topic or design challenge and how it will be approached in a concise opening sentence or paragraph.
   - Find a quote that relates to the project
   - Add details including the project's context, outstanding issues, and goals. Include aspects of how the topic is interesting, important, or novel, and how you (the team) arrived at these conclusions. what contributions does the project make or intend to make? Does it reimagine, reframe, refactor, re-contextualize, or otherwise perform remix or invention? 
 4. **Design process overview**
   - Timeline of events
   - List methods used with brief descriptions
   - Anticipated outcomes of each step
 5. **Outcomes**
   - Analyze and deconstruct the issue using [form and context analysis](https://www.core77.com/posts/69273/Book-Review-Notes-on-the-Synthesis-of-Form).
   - [Identify forces that impact form](https://vimeo.com/10875362)
   - Are there any ethical considerations?
   - Include figures and diagrams of conceptual relationships
   - Describe media used in digital production. For example, print, web, info-graphics, game/interactive, animation, video/film, audio/sound, physical installation, etc.
 7. **Lessons learned**
   - Assess how well the design process worked. What might be done to improve upon it or mitigate issues? All team members should candidly provide any issues they experienced or observed. These issues could include: Availability of team members, feeling of meaningful or equal contribution, types of design exercises used, role assignments, etc.
 8. **Bibliography**
   - You can choose either APA or MLA format for document. See [documentation resources](/documentation-resources.md) for help.

3. Proofread and spellcheck
  
#### Submission details:

Upload the PDF document to the canvas assignment by the due date and time listed.

## Team conflict

Though working on a design team as part of a class project can not fully mimic real-world project teams you will encounter or already have encountered, it should suffice for helping you understand the general concepts and ideas. Finding a team that meshes immediately and is good at resolving internal conflict makes for a very productive and gratifying project experience. Unfortunately, when this doesn't happen, it can be team dynamics can be counterproductive. If you run into any issues with your team members that cannot be resolved, please communicate with them with your instructor so they may step in and help mediate the situation.
