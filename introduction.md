# Introduction

This course follows [DMD 100: Digital Multimedia Design Foundations](https://legacy.gitbook.com/book/dmd-program/dmd-100-sp19/details). In that course, students were given a fairly rigid design process to follow with prescribed outcomes and formats. In DMD 300: Digital Multimedia Design Studio, students will have the opportunity to build their own design process and work with digital formats and tools of their choosing.
