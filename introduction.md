# Introduction

In DMD 100: Digital Multimedia Design Foundations, students engaged with the following ideas:

1. Difficult problems can be surmounted with a good design process
2. A good design process reduces bias and increases empathy;
3. Iterative improvement and feedback are important to do good work;
4. Design has ethical implications;
5. And attention to detail is just as important as understanding the larger systems and forces at play.

Though the content of the projects in DMD100 could vary widely, the methodology was standardized. Now in DMD 300: Digital Multimedia Design Studio, students will have the opportunity to build their own design process and work with digital formats and tools of their choosing.
