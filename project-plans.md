# Project Plans

Modern designers are fortunate in that there exist a great many design methods to create almost anything imaginable. While some artists, designers, and technologists are comfortable on the fringes of known processes — inventing new ways to manifest ideas into reality — most people will find an existing design methodology will suit their needs.

There are some instances in which you will need to craft your own design process, build your own tools, and organize a team.

Project plans consist of:

1. definition of project type
2. example other projects of similar type
3. Project Pipelines: suggested tools, assets, methodologies, and outcomes
