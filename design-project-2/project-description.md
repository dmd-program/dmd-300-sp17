# Design Project 2

In project 1, you tackled a real world issue. In project 2, you will produce an experimental work designed to further develop your concept development and production skills. In this project, you will develop a project concept, methodology, documentation of your process, and a presentation of the outcomes. Your work will then be collectively displayed in a class-wide exhibition of your work on a Penn State only website.

Please have a look at the list of digital design project categories.
