# Project 2

## Description
For this project, you will produce a digital design work that critically engages with the project's theme. You will also develop a design concept, production process, and a well-articulated work statement to explains your work to a wide audience. Your work will then be collectively displayed in a class-wide online exhibition.

## Project title and theme

**Project title template:** "_\[ topic \]_ Futures"

Choose a topic that is meaningful to you and apply it to the title template to assemble your project's title. The title is also the general theme of your project. For instance, to create work that engages in discourse of politics, you could create a theme called "Political Futures".

### Theme description

Futures projects are typically optimistic works that engage with important topics \(critical issues\) and examine the opportunities for improvement, change, activism, and betterment of a given situation. Futures projects are often categorized as speculative, discursive, or otherwise as critical design and tend to provide an array of potential outcomes. There are no hard definitions for how futures projects are created, but they often tend to mix fictional elements while maintaining firm grip with contemporary reality—meaning that futures projects often tend to take place or speculate about the future, yet have currency in present day life.

**Example futures projects and topics:**

* [Near Future Design](http://www.artisopensource.net/projects/near-future-design/)

## Project media
If you are unsure of what types of digital projects are available to create, please have a look at the list of [digital design project types](/digital-design-project-types.md). This is not a comprehensive list, but you should be able to locate your own creative interests within.

## Online Exhibition

Exhibitions typically have a central theme—a conceptual thread that links the work together. Exhibition curators contextualize selected works which often ascribes new or additional meaning to the individual works as a result. The online exhibition's theme will be chosen after student projects are completed. DMD 300 online exhibitions are designed to run back to back, and will last until the next cohort of DMD 300 students participate. This makes the exhibition duration somewhat variable, but should not last more than one year and no less than a single semester. Your instructor will coordinate the exhibition, which will be available in two options; a Penn State only online exhibition, and a fully public online exhibition. Students choosing to participate in the fully public exhibition will also have their work shown in the Penn State only exhibition. Students participating in the Penn State only exhibition will not have work shown in the fully public exhibition. The fully public exhibition will be maintained on the DMD program website as an archive after the exhibition has ended—incorporating willing students' work into the program's heritage.
