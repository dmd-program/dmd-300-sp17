# Design Project 2

For this project, you will produce a digital design work that critically engages with the project's theme. Strengthening your creative interests, you will develop a project concept, methodology, process documentation, and a professional presentation of outcomes. Your work will then be collectively displayed in a class-wide online exhibition accessible by the greater Penn State community.

## Project title and theme

**Project title template:** "_\[ topic \]_ Futures"

Choose a topic that is meaningful to you and apply it to the theme name template to assemble your project's title. For instance, to create work that engages in discourse of politics, you could create a theme called "Political Futures".

If you are unsure of what types of digital projects are available to create, please have a look at the list of digital design project categories.

## Requirements

1. 500 Word Minimum Work Statement
3. Fully functional digital artifacts

## Deliverables

1. Project pitch
2. Production Reports
3. Project Submission
   1. Work statement that uses design language
   2. Project files:
      * **Any of the following:** High quality images, video, PDF document, executable file for download, Zip archive of files, URL of live hosted website \(not a link to a paid web service such as InvisionApp\), production blog URL, etc.
      * For archival purposes, the files must be as self-contained as possible. If I were to look at them without an Internet connection, would the project still work?
4. Completed online exhibition information and approval form
   1. Desired attribution name for work \(This can be a pseudonym if you do not wish to publish your name\)
   2. Title of project
   3. Project description: \(Between 75 and 150 words\)
   4. Project Image: 1200px by 1200px minimum \(This should be a single image that visually represents the project\)

## Online Exhibition

Exhibitions typically have a central theme—a conceptual thread that links the work together. Exhibition curators contextualize selected works which often ascribes new or additional meaning to the individual works as a result. The online exhibition's theme will be chosen after student projects are completed. DMD 300 online exhibitions are designed to run back to back, and will last until the next cohort of DMD 300 students participate. This makes the exhibition duration somewhat variable, but should not last more than one year and no less than a single semester. Your instructor will coordinate the exhibition, which will be available in two options; a Penn State only online exhibition, and a fully public online exhibition. Students choosing to participate in the fully public exhibition will also have their work shown in the Penn State only exhibition. Students participating in the Penn State only exhibition will not have work shown in the fully public exhibition. The fully public exhibition will be maintained on the DMD program website as an archive after the exhibition has ended—incorporating willing students' work into the program's heritage.

## Rubric

1. Produced and submitted project deliverables according to requirements: 40%
2. Project outcomes: 
   * Concept: 20%
   * Craft: 20%
   * Participation in online exhibition: 20%
