# Project 2

## Description
For this project, you will produce a digital design work that critically engages with the project's theme. You will also develop a design concept, production process, and a well-articulated work statement to explains your work to a wide audience. Your work will then be collectively displayed in a class-wide online exhibition.

## Project title and theme

**Project title template:** "_\[ topic \]_ Futures"

Choose a topic that is meaningful to you and apply it to the title template to assemble your project's title. The title is also the general theme of your project. For instance, to create work that engages in discourse of politics, you could create a theme called "Political Futures".

### Theme description

Futures projects are typically optimistic works that engage with important topics \(critical issues\) and examine the opportunities for improvement, change, activism, and betterment of a given situation. Futures projects are often categorized as speculative, discursive, or otherwise as critical design and tend to provide an array of potential outcomes. There are no hard definitions for how futures projects are created, but they often tend to mix fictional elements while maintaining firm grip with contemporary reality—meaning that futures projects often tend to take place or speculate about the future, yet have currency in present day life.

**Example futures projects and topics:**

* [Near Future Design](http://www.artisopensource.net/projects/near-future-design/)
* [AIGA Design futures](https://www.aiga.org/aiga-design-futures/introduction-to-design-futures/)
* [RISD Repair and Design Futures](https://risdmuseum.org/exhibitions-events/exhibitions/repair-and-design-futures)

## Project production

### Project type
If you are unsure of what types of digital projects are available to create, please have a look at the list of [digital design project types](/digital-design-project-types.md).

### Production process

You will define tools, processes, and methods, and a project timeline for the concept pitch. You will not be prescribed a research

## Deliverables

1. **[Production blog](/design-project-2/project-2-production-reports.md)** (Canvas)
2. **[Concept pitch](/design-project-2/project-2-concept-pitch.md)** (Canvas, production blog)
3. **[Production Reports](/design-project-2/project-2-production-reports.md)** (Production blog)
4. **[Work statement](/design-project-2/project-2-work-statement.md)** that uses design language (Canvas, production blog)
5. **Project files:** (Canvas)
  1. Any of the following: High quality images, photographs, video, PDF document, executable file for download (macOS and Windows compatible), Zip archive of files, URL of live hosted website \(not a link to a paid web service such as InvisionApp\), production blog URL, etc.
  2. For archival purposes, the files must be as self-contained as possible. (I.E.–if I were to look at them without an Internet connection, would the project still work?)
6. **[Project documentation](/design-project-2/project-2-documentation.md)**
7. **Online exhibition information form:** [Form Link](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=RY30fNs9iUOpwcEVUm61LpKTUYPpqWVNtct2hclEf_pUNkI5Sk9URUNURVg1RTFZOTdHMDQ3TFhVMC4u)

## Online Exhibition

Exhibitions typically have a central theme—a conceptual thread that links the work together. Exhibition curators contextualize selected works which often ascribes new or additional meaning to the individual works as a result. The online exhibition's theme will be chosen after student projects are completed. DMD 300 online exhibitions are designed to run back to back, and will last until the next cohort of DMD 300 students participate. This makes the exhibition duration somewhat variable, but should not last more than one year and no less than a single semester. Your instructor will coordinate the exhibition, which will be available in two options; a Penn State only online exhibition, and a fully public online exhibition. Students choosing to participate in the fully public exhibition will also have their work shown in the Penn State only exhibition. Students participating in the Penn State only exhibition will not have work shown in the fully public exhibition. The fully public exhibition will be maintained on the DMD program website as an archive after the exhibition has ended—incorporating willing students' work into the program's heritage.

## Rubric

All project deliverables must be met for the project to be graded. A non-submission or non-completion for any part of the project is considered an incomplete project.

1. Complied with all deliverable requirements: 20%
2. Project outcomes: 
   * Concept: 20%
   * Craft: 20%
   * Work Statement: 20%
   * Participation in online exhibition: 20%
