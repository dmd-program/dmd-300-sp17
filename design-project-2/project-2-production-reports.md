A production report is a comprehensive update about what progress has been made. A report can consist of any visual or text description and may include screenshot images, photographs of prototypes, video of working functionality, code snippets, production artwork, concept maps, research findings, work inspiration, storyboards and scripts, etc.

All reports should be published on the production blog by the due dates indicated on the project schedule.
