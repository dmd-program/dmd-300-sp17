# Project 2 Work Statement

Develop a 150â€“500 word work statement that thoughtfully employs relevant and critical art and design language. This statement should be developed with feedback from your instructor to adjust tone, terminology, and structure. You will use MS Word tracked changes to refine and edit the statement over the duration of the project.

The statement's use of language should seek a balance of accurate technical terminology, concise statements about the work, and language that is accessible to a diverse audience and is wholly descriptive. It is easy for artists and designers to adopt opaque language when attempting to describe abstract works. Developing playful language can be a fun exercise, but has the tendency to confuse or shut out those with-out a strong grasp of obscure and creatively applied vocabulary. There are really no rules with how language is used, but ultimately the goal in a work statement is that the artist or designer can clearly communicate their ideas, processes, and outcomes to a wide audience.

## Structure of the work statement

1. Explain what the project is and how it works.
   1. "This project is an online game for children that teaches players living in war-torn countries how to avoid landmines." 
2. Describe the type of media used.
3. Describe the design challenge \(the provocation, or existing problem you hope to tackle\)
4. Describe the process or how you approached solving for the design challenge
5. Describe the impact the work might have, the context in which it sits, why it's interesting, etc.
