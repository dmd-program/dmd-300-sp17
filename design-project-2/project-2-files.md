# Project 2 Files

The following are examples of project file types:

1. High resolution images
2. photo documentation
3. video
4. Pre-press PDF documents
5. executable game or app file for download (macOS and Windows compatible)
6. Zip archive of files
7. URL of live website \(not a link to a paid web service such as InvisionApp\)

For archival purposes, the files must be as self-contained as possible. (I.E.â€“if I were to look at them without an Internet connection, would the project still work? This will not always be possible given the nature of certain projects.)

## Submission details:

1. Upload to canvas by the deadline.
