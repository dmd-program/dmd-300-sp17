# Concept development

A concept is the core idea \(or set of ideas\) that signify core values inherent in a project, process, or thing. Even when not explicitly stated, the concept is the intellectual and practical motivation behind any endeavored project. Concepts can range from simple, subjective, and abstract to complex, hyper-specific, and didactic.

## Synthesizing vs generating concepts

Sometimes you are given a concept to respond to when producing work, and sometimes you produce work and analyze the outcomes to develop concepts after the fact. Concept-first is often referred to as a **Top-down Approach**. A project in-which the concept comes after something is produced is referred to as a **Bottom-up Approach**. Often, you will set out pursuing one concept, only to change after you have started or have finished a project.

## Mental model

**Synonyms:** World view; perspective; conceptual understanding.

A mental model is your interpretation of how a something works. Mental models develop based on a person's total personal experiences, and there is no fundamental difference between someone's "perspective" and their mental model. If someone has been deemed an expert in a particular area, it is often because they have been privy to a large variety of mental models, evaluated them, and applied logic and reason to land on the most correct model as their basis for understanding. Mental models can be created on the fly, and there sometimes are no correct ones, or it is at least not possible to know if one is correct. This is why forming an absolute opinion is a hinderance to good design, the model can and should change at any time, and while they should be vetted for ethics, safety, and inclusion, ignoring or disregarding an alternate mental model ultimately hinders innovation.

**Developing and inventing new mental models is how insight is created.** Insights are a form of knowledge, so developing a new mental model creates new knowledge and expands the world as humans experience it. 

In politics, you often see people with a mix of absolute perspectives, flexible perspectives depending on what presents the most opportunity \(negatively termed flip-flopping\), and open-minded perspectives able to adopt new mental models as logic and reason dictate. Leading a community, country, and society with diverse, often conflicting array of mental models can be daunting, discouraging, and often deflating. This is why unwavering optimism is a key attribute to become a great designer. A pragmatist can produce mediocre design, be coerced into maintain the status quo to avoid risk or "rocking the boat". But a pragmatist has the potential to have positive impact when the risk is low. A pessimist is almost always never going to do anything new or innovative, and will find reasons not to disrupt, alter, or impact to any degree the world for the better. You will always be given reasons not to pursue something. To do anything, one must have some level of optimism, and the more you have, the greater the risk of failure.

## Meaning making

Semantics. Semiotics. Ontology. Phenomenology.

## Process

A process should be custom tailored for each project.

It's helpful to understand that the process is a tool to help you get to the end-point of a project more quickly or without the need for as many iterations. Changing a process mid-stream can be beneficial, particularly, if you stumbled onto a new process. This will create unpredictable outcomes that are often times novel and exciting.
