# Concept development

Simply put, a concept is the core idea (or ideas) that helps us understand why we should care. Even when not explicitly stated, it is the intellectual and practical motivation behind any endeavored project. Concepts can range from simple, subjective, and abstract to complex, hyper-specific, and didactic.

## Synthesizing vs generating concepts

Sometimes you are given a concept to respond to when producing work, and sometimes you produce work and analyze the outcomes to develop concepts after the fact. Concept-first is often referred to as a top-down approach. Concept-last is referred to as a bottom-up approach. Often times, you will set out pursuing one concept, only to switch after you have started or have finished a project.

## Process

A process should be custom tailored for each project.

It's helpful to understand that the process is a tool to help you get to the end-point of a project more quickly or without the need for as many iterations. Changing a process mid-stream can be beneficial, particularly, if you stumbled onto a new process. This will create unpredictable outcomes that are often times novel and exciting.
