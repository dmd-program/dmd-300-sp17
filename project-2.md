# Design Project 2 : NAME TBD \(Self-directed Project\)

Design Project 2 is meant to mimic the format of the capstone project, with a bit more feedback along the way. In this project, you will develop a methodology, documentation of your process, and a presentation of the outcomes. Your work will then be displayed in a class-wide exposition of your work.

1. Define a project proposal \(3 weeks\)
   1. Outcomes
   2. Context and impact
   3. Themes
   4. Scope: What can you do in 6 weeks?
   5. Identify a production process and timeline
   6. Identify faculty or industry mentor
   7. If a group project, it roles and workload must be defined.
2. 3 Check-ins with mentor
   1. Notes or takeaways from meeting with mentor
   2. Student facilitates meeting by being prepared to show progress and have questions for mentor.
3. Project deliverables
   1. Project should either be based on a clearly defined career intention or a well defined concept and theme. Expressive art projects must be well articulated in the project statement.
   2. 500 Word Minimum Statement
   3. Fully functional digital artifacts 
   4. PDF Documentation complies with presentation guidelines
4. Deliver a final presentation and contribution for student exposition of work.
